My name is Rich Tregaro. I am currently a student of data science at Lambda School.  

- Loving my Mini Dachshund Harley-Quinn
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else is there?

### My history:

I'm currently in the process of making a carrer change, from the field of surgical medicine to a career as a data scientist.  For 17 years, I have worked as a Surgical Technologist throughout the Greater Los Angeles Area, but recently decided to take a chance and dive head first into a completely new field of study.  I applied to be a student at Lambda School, and was accepted into the fifth Data Science cohort(DS5) that began on  May 28th, 2019.  So far, it has been the hardest thing I have ever attempted in my life, but I am absolutely certain the end result will be more than worth the struggle to get there!
