My name is Rich Tregaro. I am currently a student of data science at Lambda School.  

- Loving my Mini Dachshund Harley-Quinn
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else is there?

### my history

I'm currently in the process of making a carrer change from the field of Surgical medicine to a career as a data scientist.  I worked as a Surgical Technologist for about 17 years, but finally decided to take the chance and dive into a completely new field of work.  I enrolled as a student at Lambda School, and was accepted into the DataScience5(DS5) class that began in May of 2019.  So far, it has been the hardest thing I have ever attempted in my life, but I know the end result will be more than worth the struggle to get there!
